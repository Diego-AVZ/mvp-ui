## 1. PROTOCOL OVERVIEW

### What is FlowFi?
FlowFi is the **all-in-one DeFi platform** that simplifies decentralized finance through four main branches: 
**Funds**, **Strategy Bundles**, **DeFi Chart**, and **DeFi Graph**.

### Core Philosophy
Our philosophy is **"DeFi in one click"** - we democratize access to sophisticated DeFi strategies 
by removing technical complexity while maintaining full transparency and security. No more navigating multiple protocols, 
managing complex transactions, or understanding intricate DeFi mechanics.

### Mission Statement
FlowFi democratizes access to sophisticated DeFi strategies by removing technical complexity while maintaining 
full transparency and security. We turn complex multi-protocol strategies that would take hours to execute manually 
into simple, automated processes that run continuously.
